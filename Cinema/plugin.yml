   cplay:
      description: Plays the given file as cinema. it plays under the playername (so u can use multiple cinemas). if you set setair to 0 stored airblocks will not be set each frame(if you build a block somewhere it will not be overwritten by an airblock). frame duration in milliseconds is the amount of time between each framechange. dont set it too low. could result in serverlags and major cpu usage.
